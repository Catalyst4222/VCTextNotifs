# VCTextNotif

[![Install in Replugged](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Install%20in%20Replugged-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=none)](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=catalyst4222/VCTextNotifs&source=github)

Get notifications for messages in chosen channels when in a voice channel


## How it works

When a message is sent, VCTextNotifs checks if:
- the user is in a voice channel
- the voice channel's id is set up in the settings
- and the message's channel is linked with the voice channel
If all of the above are true, then a notification is sent

> Note: [ReCutecord](https://github.com/ShadiestGoat/ReCutecord) must be installed for VCTextNotifs to work
